                <p>
                    To provide our students and staff with hassle-free access to banking services, we have collaborated 
                    with the State Bank of India to install Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) within the campus. These ATMs 
                    allow individuals to conduct a range of financial transactions, including cash withdrawals, balance inquiries, 
                    and more, without having to step outside the campus premises. This service saves time and ensures that financial 
                    needs are met conveniently and securely.

                    kits to handle minor injuries and emergencies promptly. For more serious medical concerns, our campus is located 
                    close to highly qualified physicians who offer consultancy services when required. During working hours, students 
                    have access to free first aid assistance, ensuring immediate attention to their medical needs. These facilities are
